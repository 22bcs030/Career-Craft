## Implementation Approach

Since we can't easily create commits with future dates, here's the approach:

1. Make all your commits today with normal timestamps
2. Push only the first commit(s) today
3. On subsequent days, push the next commit(s) in the series

For example:
- Today: Push commits from Day 1
- Tomorrow: Push commits from Day 2
- And so on...

This will create the appearance of development happening over time while maintaining an accurate Git history.

## Commands to Use

To push specific commits to the remote repository:

```powershell
# Push up to a specific commit
git push origin <commit-hash>:main
```

OR

```powershell
# First time setup
git push -u origin main

# On subsequent days, after making new commits
git push
```
